# Online Courses from coursera.org, edx.org and some public courses of Stanford.
This repository contains data, source code of online courses I attended. Some of them offered certificates
such as coursera.org and edx.org. 

## Matrix Factorization and Advanced Techniques - University of Minnesota - Grade Achieved: 96.7%

This course offers how to use matrix factorization techniques for recommender systems. It also shows metrics to evaluate 
the effectiveness of these systems. There are two programming assignments. The first one is simply implementing SVD 
recommender system. The second assignment is about how to combine hybrid recommender systems with logistic function 
and gradient ascent.
