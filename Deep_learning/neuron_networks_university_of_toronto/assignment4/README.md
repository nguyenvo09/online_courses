Neural Networks for Machine Learning
Programming Assignment 4
Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM)
#######################################

In this assignment, you will need to implement an RBM with only single hidden layer. You need to implment negative energy function, visible to hidden conditional probabilities, hidden 
to visible conditional probabilities. Finally, you need to implement gradient of energy function with respect to parameters and contrastive divergence (CD1) gradient.
